    <string name="bio">Hi, I\'m Susritha.\n\nI\'m a beginner to android development and started a course offered by udacity.
    \nI\'m trying to code everything that is taught to get hands on practice and experience.
    \nDeveloping an application seems fun like never before.
        \n\nI only had experience in web development but now I stepped into android development too.
        \n\nLet\'s see how deep the course is and how well I can grab things
        \n\nHappy learning :)!!
