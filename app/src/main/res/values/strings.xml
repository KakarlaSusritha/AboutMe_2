    <string name="bio">Android Studio preview channels Android Studio builds are available in several "preview channels".
        In general, which channel you choose for receiving updates depends upon whether you prefer to work in the most stable and bug-free environment,
        or enjoy to preview new features at the cost of occasional bugs. For this course, we recommend that you use the latest stable version, unless a feature used in
the course is not yet released in stable. There are four different preview channels, described below. See the Preview Channels
documentation for details.
■ Stable channel: Contains the most recent stable version of Android Studio.
■ Beta channel: When Android Studio reaches a beta milestone for its next version, the
beta builds are posted here.</string>
